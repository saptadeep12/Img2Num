### Keyboard Navigation Tests

Tests for keyboard accessibility:

| Test | Description | Should go to next page on ArrowRight | Right arrow key | Should go to previous page on ArrowLeft | Left arrow key | Should not go beyond last page on ArrowRight | Boundary handling | Should not go before first page on ArrowLeft | Boundary handling | Should ignore navigation in input fields | Form field awareness | Should ignore navigation in textarea | Form field awareness | Should ignore other keys | Only arrow keys work

## Test Utilities

### CSS Module Mock

```jsx
vi.mock("./Pagination.module.css", () => ({
  default: {
    pagination: "mocked-pagination-class",
    arrow: "mocked-arrow-class",
    page: "mocked-page-class",
    active: "mocked-active-class",
    ellipsis: "mocked-ellipsis-class",
  },
}));
```

### Common Test Setup

```jsx
const mockOnChange = vi.fn();

beforeEach(() => {
  mockOnChange.mockClear();
});
```

## Coverage Areas

- Conditional rendering
- Accessibility attributes
- Click handlers
- Keyboard navigation
