Nodes are responsible in computing their own contours using the Suzuki-Abe method.

The Suzuki-Abe algorithm is a border-following technique designed to extract the topological structure of binary images. Unlike simple boundary tracing, it produces two distinct outputs:

1. **Contours:** Vector lists of point coordinates representing the borders.
2. **Hierarchy:** A tree structure indicating the relationship between borders (e.g., is a border an external outline or a hole inside another shape?).

## Key Concepts

### 1. Border Types

The algorithm distinguishes between two types of borders based on the transition between 0 (background) and 1 (foreground) pixels:

- **Outer Border:** The boundary between a background region and a foreground component (surrounded by background).
- **Hole Border:** The boundary between a foreground component and an internal background hole (surrounded by foreground).

### 2. Tracking Variables

- **`f[i,j]`** : The value of the pixel at row `i` , column `j` . Initially, the image contains only `0` (background) and `1` (foreground). As the algorithm runs, `1` s are replaced by unique Border IDs.
- **`NBD` (Number of Border)** : A counter representing the current Border ID being assigned. Starts at `2` (since `1` is used for raw foreground).
- **`LNBD` (Last Number of Border)** : Tracks the Border ID of the most recently visited border during the raster scan. This acts as the "Parent" tracker.

## The Algorithm Steps

The algorithm combines a **Raster Scan** (to find new borders) with a **Border Following** routine (to trace and mark the entire boundary once found).

### Phase 1: Raster Scan

Iterate through the image row by row, from top-left to bottom-right.

1. **Reset `LNBD` :** At the start of every row, reset `LNBD = 1` (frame ID).
2. **Check Pixel `f[i,j]` :**
- **Case A (Outer Border Start):** If `f[i,j] == 1` and `f[i, j-1] == 0` (transition from empty space to object):
- Increment `NBD` .
- This is a new **Outer Border** .
- Update Hierarchy: `LNBD` is the parent of `NBD` .
- **Trigger Phase 2 (Trace Border)** starting at `(i,j)` .
- **Case B (Hole Border Start):** If `f[i,j] >= 1` and `f[i, j+1] == 0` (transition from object to empty space):
- Increment `NBD` .
- This is a new **Hole Border** .
- Update Hierarchy: `LNBD` is the parent of `NBD` . (If `f[i,j] > 1` , set `LNBD = f[i,j]` first).
- **Trigger Phase 2 (Trace Border)** starting at `(i,j)` .
- **Case C (Non-Border):** If neither A nor B, update `LNBD` if `f[i,j] != 0` and continue scanning.
3. **Case A (Outer Border Start):** If `f[i,j] == 1` and `f[i, j-1] == 0` (transition from empty space to object):
- Increment `NBD` .
- This is a new **Outer Border** .
- Update Hierarchy: `LNBD` is the parent of `NBD` .
- **Trigger Phase 2 (Trace Border)** starting at `(i,j)` .
4. Increment `NBD` .
5. This is a new **Outer Border** .
6. Update Hierarchy: `LNBD` is the parent of `NBD` .
7. **Trigger Phase 2 (Trace Border)** starting at `(i,j)` .
8. **Case B (Hole Border Start):** If `f[i,j] >= 1` and `f[i, j+1] == 0` (transition from object to empty space):
- Increment `NBD` .
- This is a new **Hole Border** .
- Update Hierarchy: `LNBD` is the parent of `NBD` . (If `f[i,j] > 1` , set `LNBD = f[i,j]` first).
- **Trigger Phase 2 (Trace Border)** starting at `(i,j)` .
9. Increment `NBD` .
10. This is a new **Hole Border** .
11. Update Hierarchy: `LNBD` is the parent of `NBD` . (If `f[i,j] > 1` , set `LNBD = f[i,j]` first).
12. **Trigger Phase 2 (Trace Border)** starting at `(i,j)` .
13. **Case C (Non-Border):** If neither A nor B, update `LNBD` if `f[i,j] != 0` and continue scanning.

### Phase 2: Border Following (The "Turtle" Logic)

Once a starting pixel `(x, y)` is found, trace the connected edge pixels until returning to the start.

1. **Search Neighborhood:** Starting from the previous pixel (or a default direction), check the 8-connected (or 4-connected) neighbors in a **Clockwise** (or Counter-Clockwise) direction.
2. **Find Next Pixel:** The first non-zero pixel found becomes the next current pixel.
3. **Mark Pixel:** Change the value of the current pixel in the image to `NBD` (or `-NBD` in specific cases to mark visited edges without destroying topology).
- *Note: This modification prevents the Raster Scan from re-detecting the same border later.*
4. *Note: This modification prevents the Raster Scan from re-detecting the same border later.*
5. **Record Coordinate:** Add the pixel `(x, y)` to the current contour vector.
6. **Termination:** Stop when the tracer returns to the **Starting Point** AND matches the **Starting Direction** .

## Hierarchy Tree Structure

The algorithm maintains a hierarchy table (often stored as an `std::array<int, 4>` : `[Next, Previous, First_Child, Parent]` ).

| Topology | Description | **Root** | The image frame (background). | **Parent** | The border immediately surrounding the current one. | **Child** | A border immediately contained within the current one. 

**Example Hierarchy:**

1. **Outer Box (ID 2)** -> Parent: Frame.
2. **Inner Hole (ID 3)** -> Parent: ID 2.
3. **Island inside Hole (ID 4)** -> Parent: ID 3.

# Contour Data Structures

This file documents the core data structures used to represent vector boundaries, Bezier curves, and the topological hierarchy of image regions.

## 1. Geometric Primitives

### `struct Point`

A fundamental 2D coordinate representing a position in the image space.

| Member | Type | Description | `x` | `float` | Horizontal coordinate (column). Uses `float` to support sub-pixel precision or smooth vector coordinates. | `y` | `float` | Vertical coordinate (row). 

### `struct QuadBezier`

Represents a Quadratic Bezier curve segment. This is used when the raw pixel contours are approximated or smoothed into vector paths.

| Member | Type | Description | `p0` | `Point` | **Start Point:** The anchor point where the curve begins. | `p1` | `Point` | **Control Point:** The handle that determines the curve's tangent and shape. The curve generally does not pass through this point. | `p2` | `Point` | **End Point:** The anchor point where the curve ends. 

## 2. Contour Results

### `struct ContoursResult`

The primary container for the output of the contour extraction algorithm (e.g., Suzuki-Abe). It separates the raw pixel data from the topological relationship data.

#### Member Variables

| Member Variable | Type | Description | `contours` | `vector<vector<Point>>` | A list of contours. `contours[k]` is a vector of `Point` s tracing the boundary of the k k k -th region. | `curves` | `vector<vector<QuadBezier>>` | A vectorized representation of `contours` . `curves[k]` contains the Bezier segments approximating the k k k -th contour. | `hierarchy` | `vector<array<int, 4>>` | Topological tree structure describing how contours nest within each other (see **Hierarchy Structure** below). | `is_hole` | `vector<bool>` | Flags the type of border. `true` if `contours[k]` is an internal hole; `false` if it is an external boundary. 

#### Hierarchy Structure ( `std::array<int, 4>` )

The `hierarchy` vector follows the standard structure (compatible with OpenCV) to represent the nesting tree. For the k k k -th contour, `hierarchy[k]` contains:

| Index | Name | Description | `0` | **Next Sibling** | Index of the next contour at the same tree level. `-1` if none. | `1` | **Prev Sibling** | Index of the previous contour at the same tree level. `-1` if none. | `2` | **First Child** | Index of the first contour nested *inside* this contour. `-1` if no children. | `3` | **Parent** | Index of the contour that surrounds this contour. `-1` if it is a root/frame contour. 

## 3. Visual Extension

### `struct ColoredContours`

**Inherits from:**`ContoursResult`

Extends the geometric data with visual attributes, specifically assigning a color to each contour. This is useful for visualization or when contours inherit the color properties of the underlying image nodes.

| Member Variable | Type | Description | `colors` | `vector<RGBAPixel<uint8_t>>` | A parallel vector to `contours` . `colors[k]` holds the RGBA color associated with the k k k -th contour.
