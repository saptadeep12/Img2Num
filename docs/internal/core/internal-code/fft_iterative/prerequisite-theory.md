# Prerequisite Theory

URL: https://img2num.dev/docs/internal/core/internal-code/fft_iterative/prerequisite-theory

:::info Prerequisites

This section assumes familiarity with the below:

- `Complex numbers` (including Euler's formula)
- Basic `trigonometry and calculus`
- Introductory concepts in `signals`
- Systems such as `periodicity and sampling`
No advanced math beyond these basics is required, but some intuition for time and frequency domains will be helpful.

:::

The list of prerequisites and helpful resources can be found below.

### Signals & systems / sampling theory

- **Intro Signals & Systems (textbook or course)**

- Read the introductory chapters on continuous vs discrete signals, linearity, and sampling.

### DFT / FFT practicals and coding

- **NumPy / SciPy docs — `numpy.fft` and `scipy.fft`**

- Practical examples for computing FFTs, `fftshift` , real-input symmetry, and inverse transforms.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/routines.fft.html)
- [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/fft.html)
- **Richard Lyons — *Understanding Digital Signal Processing* (book)**

- Very practical, engineering-focused explanations and examples (recommended chapters on DFT/FFT).
- [Understanding Digital Signal Processing](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/341426/Understanding_digital_signal_processing.pdf)

- **Small hands-on project** :
- Load a simple 1-D signal (sine + noise), compute `np.fft.fft` , plot magnitude/phase, then `ifft` to verify reconstruction.
- Try zero-padding and `fftshift` to see visualization effects.

### Visual / interactive tools

- **Desmos or GeoGebra** — quickly plot complex exponentials, sines/cosines, and see effects of phase/amplitude changes.
- **Online FFT visualizers** — interactively play with windowing, zero-padding and see spectral leakage (search for "FFT visualizer" or "spectral leakage demo").
