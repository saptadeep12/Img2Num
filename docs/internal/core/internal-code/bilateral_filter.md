# Bilateral Filter

URL: https://img2num.dev/docs/internal/core/internal-code/bilateral_filter

This section introduces the **bilateral filter** used in the Img2Num project (see [`bilateral_filter.h`](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/blob/main/src/wasm/modules/image/include/bilateral_filter.h) & [`bilateral_filter.cpp`](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/blob/main/src/wasm/modules/image/src/bilateral_filter.cpp) ). It focuses on how the algorithm is implemented, why each step is necessary, and where the corresponding code lives so you can jump straight into the implementation.

:::important Why Img2Num Uses Bilateral Filters In Img2Num, the bilateral filter is used to **reduce noise while preserving edges** , which is critical for accurate image segmentation (via methods like K-Means clustering), contour extraction and vectorization.

Similarly to Gaussian blurs, it acts as a *low-pass filter* that reduces noise. Conversely, it is *less aggressive than Gaussian blurs, since it takes spatial position (x & y coordinates) into account* - allowing it to preserve sharp edges. :::

## At a glance

- **Algorithm:** Bilateral Filter (Non-linear, edge-preserving).
- **Input/Output image data types:**`uint8_t` (8-bit unsigned integer channels).
- **Color spaces:** RGB & CIELAB can be chosen (see `color_space` in the**API / Usage** section ).
- **Key steps:**
1. For each pixel, inspect neighbors in radius R R R .
2. Weight neighbors by **spatial distance** (Gaussian).
3. Weight neighbors by **intensity/color difference** (Gaussian).
4. Normalize and average.
