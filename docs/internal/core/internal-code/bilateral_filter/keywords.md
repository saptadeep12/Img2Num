- **spatial component** : The part of an image related to the **pixel positions** (x and y coordinates).
In the bilateral filter, this determines how **neighboring pixels are weighted based on distance** from the center pixel.
- **range component** : The part of an image related to **pixel values** , such as color, brightness, or intensity.
In the bilateral filter, this determines how **neighboring pixels are weighted based on similarity in color or intensity** .
- **kernel / window / bounding box** : A local subset of pixels around the center pixel.

- This is the region over which the bilateral filter computes weighted averages.
- Gaussian functions define the **weights for each pixel in the kernel** , considering both spatial and range components.
- **standard deviation ( σ \sigma σ )** : A measure of how spread out values are from their mean.

- In the bilateral filter, σ \sigma σ controls the **width of the Gaussian weighting** .
- **σ s p a t i a l \sigma_{spatial} σ s p a t ia l** : Controls the influence of **distance** — larger values allow more distant pixels to contribute.
- **σ r a n g e \sigma_{range} σ r an g e** : Controls the influence of **color/intensity differences** — larger values make edges less sharp.
- **LUT (Look-Up Table)** : A precomputed array mapping input values to output values to **avoid repeated computation** .

- In the bilateral filter, RGB range weights are often stored in a LUT for **fast access** , while CIELAB weights are computed on the fly.
- **weighted average** : A sum of values multiplied by their corresponding weights, then normalized by the total weight.

- The bilateral filter uses this to combine neighbor pixels into the **filtered center pixel value** .
- **edge preservation** : The ability of the filter to **smooth flat regions while maintaining sharp transitions** at boundaries between different colors or intensities.
