# Scripts & help CLI

URL: https://img2num.dev/docs/internal/scripts/help-scripts/scripts-guide

This page describes the changes introduced in [PR #135 — Add `scriptsInfo` metadata and CI validation for script documentation](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/pull/135) and documents how to use the new `scriptsInfo` metadata, the `validate-scripts` tool, the refactored `help` CLIs, and the CI integration that validates script documentation on PRs.

:::info Short Summary Package-level `scriptsInfo` is now the single source of truth for documenting custom npm scripts. The repo includes a `validate-scripts` check in `ci.yml` that enforces a strict 1:1 mapping between `scripts` and `scriptsInfo` . The `help` CLIs were refactored to read this metadata and a GitHub Actions workflow runs this validation on script-related changes and can annotate PRs when validation fails. :::

## `scriptsInfo` — schema & examples

`package.json` (root and `docs/package.json` ) now support a top-level `scriptsInfo` object. It provides structured documentation for custom `npm` scripts and is intended to be human- and machine-readable.

A minimal example:

scriptsInfo comes before scripts to serve as a clearer interface to anyone viewing the file

```json
{
  "scriptsInfo": {
    "build-wasm": {
      "group": "build",
      "desc": "Build the WebAssembly modules used by the app.",
      "args": ["<target>", "Optional target; e.g. 'release' or 'debug'"]
    },
    "help": {
      "group": "dev",
      "desc": ["Interactive help for available npm scripts."],
      "args": []
    }
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build-wasm": "make -C src/wasm build",
    "help": "node scripts/help.js"
  }
}
```

:::note Notes on the schema used in this PR:

- `scriptsInfo` is an object whose keys exactly match the `scripts` keys in `package.json` .
- Each script entry may include:

- `group` — logical grouping used in the help CLI (e.g. `dev` , `build` , `docs` ).
- `desc` — a string or an array of strings (multi-line descriptions supported).
- `args` — an array describing positional or named args the script accepts.
- The validator enforces a strict 1:1 mapping; every `scripts` entry must have a corresponding `scriptsInfo` entry and vice versa.

- This ensures the scripts are properly documented. :::

## Adding or updating scripts

1. Add your script command under `scripts` in `package.json` .
2. Add a matching entry in `scriptsInfo` using the schema above.

```json
"<script-name>": {
  "group": "<category-it-falls-under>",
  "desc": "<script's-description>",
  "args": [
    "<optional-arg1>",
    "<optional-arg2>",
    ...
    "<optional-argx>"
  ]
}
```
3. Run the validator locally before pushing:

```bash
npm run validate-scripts
```

:::caution If the validator exits non-zero Fix any missing or mismatched `scriptsInfo` entries. :::

## `validate-scripts` tool & CI

The repository includes `scripts/validate-scripts.js` (and an npm script `validate-scripts` ) which:

- Loads `./package.json` and `./docs/package.json` .
- Flattens the `scriptsInfo` structure (if grouped) and compares the set of keys with the `scripts` object.
- Exits with non-zero status if there are missing or extra entries, printing helpful error messages.

### CI integration

A GitHub Actions workflow ( `.github/workflows/ci.yml` ) was added to:

- Detect if changes in a push/PR touched script-related files.
- Run `npm ci` and then `npm run validate-scripts` when relevant.
- Capture validator output and — on failures — call a reusable commenter workflow that posts the validation output back to the PR as a comment.
This ensures documentation for scripts can't be accidentally left out of a PR.

> Tip: If you're working on a branch and the CI complains, run the validator locally and iterate until it passes.

## Refactored `help` CLI

:::info The old `help.js` was refactored to:

- Read `scripts` and `scriptsInfo` from `package.json` (the source of truth).
- Delegate the fuzzy listing/search UI to a shared orchestrator ( `scripts/lib/cli-fuzzy.js` ).
- Support multi-line descriptions and CLI args rendering. :::

### Usage Examples

Run the help CLI from the repo root

```bash
npm run help
```

Arguments (immediately passed to fuzzy search)

```bash
npm run help -- help build
```

### CLI features

- Fuzzy search of script names and descriptions.
- Grouped presentation of scripts.
- Colorized & formatted output for readability.

## Shared utilities

Shared helper modules live under `scripts/lib/` and are used by both the root app and `docs` app:

- `cli-fuzzy.js` — orchestrates rendering of fuzzy-search-based interactive help.
- `colors.js` — terminal color helpers and formatting.
- `read-packageJson-scripts.js` — small helper to safely read and return `scripts` + `scriptsInfo` from package manifests.
- `validate-scripts.js` — the validator described above (also present at `scripts/validate-scripts.js` ).
When modifying or adding helpers, keep in mind both root and `docs` apps import these relative utilities.

## Troubleshooting & common failures

- **Validator fails saying a script is missing from `scriptsInfo`** : add the scriptsInfo entry with the correct key.
- **Validator finds an extra `scriptsInfo` key** : remove or rename the `scripts` or `scriptsInfo` entry to match.
- **CI workflow errors about `actions/checkout` runner** : update the `actions/checkout@v3` action ref if actionlint or GitHub Actions suggests a newer pinned version (the existing workflow contains a small actionlint note — consider updating to the latest stable minor release if needed).

## Contributing & making changes

- Update both `package.json` (or `docs/package.json` ) `scripts` and `scriptsInfo` together.
- Run `npm run validate-scripts` locally before opening a PR.
- If you touch scripts, remember CI will run the validator and may annotate your PR with the output if validation fails.
