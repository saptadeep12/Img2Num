# 🧹 Clean Scripts

URL: https://img2num.dev/docs/internal/scripts/clean-scripts

## `npm run clean`

Cleans both WebAssembly and Vite build folders.

```bash
npm run clean-wasm && npm run clean-js
```

Ensures the project returns to a "fresh" state.

## `npm run clean-js`

Removes the Vite build output directory:

```bash
rimraf dist
```

## `npm run clean-wasm`

Delegates to:

```bash
node scripts/build-wasm.js --clean
```

`scripts/build-wasm.js` handles the deletion of build files.

This calls the [orchestrator CMakeLists.txt's](https://github.com/Ryan-Millard/Img2Num/blob/main/src/wasm/CMakeLists.txt)`clean` script, which calls the `clean` script in every WASM module.
