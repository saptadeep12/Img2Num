# Img2Num JavaScript Requirements

URL: https://img2num.dev/docs/js/requirements

## Requirements

### Browser (client-side)

- **WebAssembly** support (all evergreen browsers).
- **ES2020** JavaScript features. In practice, any browser from 2020 onward works.
- For the ESM build, **native ES module** support ( `<script type="module">` ). The [IIFE and UMD builds](/docs/js/installation/#using-a-cdn) have no module-system requirement - a plain `<script>` tag is enough.
- **Not supported:** Internet Explorer 11 or older browsers without WebAssembly.
WebGPU is optional
Img2Num uses WebGPU for acceleration when the browser exposes it, and falls back to CPU (WASM) when it doesn't. No browser feature beyond WebAssembly is strictly required.

### Node.js (server-side)

- [**Node ≥ 18**](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.0.0) is required.
- Both module systems are supported: `import` resolves the Node ESM build and `require()` resolves the CJS build — no flags, no interop wrappers.
- GPU acceleration in Node is provided by the optional [`webgpu`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webgpu) dependency. If it isn't installed (or fails to install on your platform), Img2Num logs a warning and falls back to CPU.

### Choosing a build

The package ships separate browser, standalone, and Node artifacts; the right one is normally selected automatically via the `exports` map:

| Environment | Artifact | Selected by | Browser via bundler or `<script type="module">` | `dist/browser/img2num.js` (ESM) | `browser` / `default` condition | Browser via plain `<script>` tag | `dist/standalone/img2num.iife.js` | manual, or CDN default ( [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/img2num) / [unpkg](https://app.unpkg.com/img2num) ) | Browser via AMD (RequireJS) | `dist/standalone/img2num.umd.js` | manual | Node.js | `dist/node/img2num.js` (ESM) / `dist/node/img2num.cjs` (CJS) | `node` condition 

### Files and bundlers

- The browser ESM and Node builds load a **separate `.wasm` file** that ships alongside the JS in the package. Bundlers (Vite, Webpack 5, Rollup) resolve it via `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` and copy it into your build output automatically — no special configuration needed in most setups.
- The **standalone IIFE/UMD builds have the WASM inlined** , so they are a single file with nothing extra to serve. This is what makes them work from a bare `<script>` tag and CDNs.
- The raw `.wasm` binary is also exposed as a package subpath for tooling that needs to reference it directly. In Vite, use the `?url` suffix:

Vite example

```js
import wasmUrl from "img2num/wasm?url";
```

- The file is copied into your build output and `wasmUrl` resolves to its final path. Don't omit the suffix — a bare `import ... from "img2num/wasm"` makes Vite treat the file as a WebAssembly *module* and fails with a misleading `"default" is not exported` error.
- In plain Node, `require.resolve("img2num/wasm")` gives the absolute path on disk.
- The package declares `sideEffects` so unused code can be tree-shaken safely.
- No runtime JS dependencies are required — the package is pure JS + WASM. ( `webgpu` for Node is optional, as above.)
